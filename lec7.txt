Q1) What are the generic font families? Explain in details with examples
1)Serif:
Serif fonts have small decorative lines or strokes at the ends of characters. They 
are commonly associated with a more traditional or formal appearance.
Examples: Times New Roman, Georgia, serif.
2)Sans-serif:
Sans-serif fonts do not have the small decorative lines or strokes at the ends of 
characters. They are often considered more modern and have a cleaner and 
simpler appearance.
Examples: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.
3)Monospace:
Monospace fonts have fixed-width characters where each character occupies the 
same amount of horizontal space. This makes them useful for displaying code or 
maintaining alignment.
Examples: Courier New, Lucida Console, monospace.
4)Cursive:
Cursive fonts emulate handwriting or calligraphy styles, with flowing and 
connected letterforms. They are often used to convey a sense of elegance or 
creativity.
Examples: Brush Script MT, Comic Sans MS, cursive.
5)Fantasy:
Fantasy fonts are decorative and unique, often used for special effects or stylized 
headings. They can vary widely in appearance and are not easily classified.
Examples: Impact, Papyrus, fantasy.
Q2) It is recommended to use each family of generic fonts in fallback style. Why?
Using each family of generic fonts in a fallback style is recommended to ensure 
that the text on your web page remains legible and maintains a consistent 
appearance across different devices and platforms
By using each family of generic fonts in the fallback style, you provide a reliable 
fallback mechanism that ensures your text remains readable and consistent, 
regardless of the availability of specific fonts on different devices
