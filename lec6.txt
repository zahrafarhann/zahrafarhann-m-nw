1)What are the differences between the opacity property and 
alpha channel in rgba or hsla?
1)Opacity Property:
-The opacity property is a single value (range: 0 to 1) that 
applies to the entire element and its contents, including text 
and child elements.
-It affects the element and all its descendants uniformly, 
making them transparent.
-When an element is set to a lower opacity, it affects not only 
the visual appearance but also the interaction with the 
element.The element and its contents become less visible, and 
any events triggered within the element will be less responsive.
-The opacity property affects the entire element, including its 
background, border, and any child elements, regardless of their 
individual opacity settings.
-The opacity property can be animated using CSS transitions or 
animations.
2)Alpha Channel in RGBA and HSLA:
-The alpha channel is a separate value (range: 0 to 1) that is 
added to an RGBA or HSLA color, allowing you to control the 
transparency of the specific color.
-It affects only the color value it is applied to and does not 
affect the element's background, border, or child elements.
-You can specify different alpha values for different colors 
within a single element, allowing for more granular control over 
transparency.
-The alpha channel does not affect the interaction with the 
element. Even if a color has a low alpha value, the element and 
its contents will still respond to events as if they were fully 
opaque.
-The alpha channel in RGBA or HSLA colors can be used for 
more sophisticated effects, such as creating gradients with 
varying transparency levels or overlaying semi-transparent 
colors on top of each other.
-The alpha channel in RGBA and HSLA can also be animated 
using CSS transitions or animations.
2)What is the most effective method for setting CSS color 
properties?
-Keyword Values,- Hexadecimal Values,-RGBA and HSLA Values
3) Create 3 divisions in a web page.
